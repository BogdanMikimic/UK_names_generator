Random UK Name Generator

Note - it is NOT a traditional English name generator (see bellow)

This Python script generates random male or female full names composed of 1 to 3 (first and middle) names and
a surname by default, and returns them as strings. It can be configured to serve only male or female full names
and a desired number of first (and middle) names, but requires at least one.

The names are selected based on specified gender criteria from pre-defined lists found in the names_list folder:
f_names.txt contains female names, m_names.txt contains male names, while surnames.txt
contains surnames.

The names and surname lists were compiled from public available data from the UK's Office for National Statistics
(https://www.ons.gov.uk/) and consists of existing registered baby names, therefore traditional English names
are mixed with names that are associated with cultures from other parts of the world.

Examples of generated names:
Yareli Angel Milena Sharp
Sevyn Selene Nicholson
Alani Johnson
Blaine Carr
Harley Oâ€™connor
Hezekiah Elijah Marvin Brady
